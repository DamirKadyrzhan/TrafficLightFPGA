# Pedestrian Crossing Traffic Lights implemented in FPGA 

I have created a finiste state machine based system that emulates the operation of a set of pedestrian crossing lights. It follows standard UK sequence of green, amber, red, red/amber lights. The light for pedestrians are only red and green ('cross' and 'don't cross').

# Main File 

Main file can be implemented into FPGA and have an output to any LED system. 

# Test Bench File 

To test the code, test bench consists of simulated clock that can after be used to represent the system in ModelSim.
